    <h1>Some Information About Cats</h1>
	The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin.
	<p> Since cats were venerated in ancient Egypt, they were commonly believed to have been domesticated there, but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9,500 years ago (7,500 BC). A genetic study in 2007 concluded that all domestic cats are descended from Near Eastern wildcats, having diverged around 8,000 BC in the Middle East. </p>

    <h1>History and Mythology</h1>
    <b> Traditionally, historians tended to think ancient Egypt was the site of cat domestication, owing to the clear depictions of house cats in Egyptian paintings about 3,600 years old.</b>
	<i>Direct evidence for the domestication of cats 5,300 years ago in Quanhucun, China has been published by archaeologists and paleontologists from the University of Washington and Chinese Academy of Sciences. The cats are believed to have been attracted to the village by rodents, which in turn were attracted by grain cultivated and stored by humans.</i>
